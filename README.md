# Latest update üóûÔ∏è (start here first üëá)
Vuln Cost is no longer being actively maintained. While you can continue to use this extension until it is officially deprecated, we recommend you install [the official Snyk extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=snyk-security.snyk-vulnerability-scanner). This new extension provides all the functionality supported by Vuln Cost and enables you to find and fix issues in both your open source dependencies AND your custom code.

## Vuln Cost - Security Scanner for VS Code

- [Github repository](https://github.com/snyk/vulncost)

## Getting started
- [Getting started guide](https://github.com/snyk/vulncost/blob/master/GETTING-STARTED.MD)

## Vulnerability scanning in VS Code

Find security vulnerabilities in open source packages while you code in JavaScript, TypeScript and HTML.
Receive feedback in-line with your code, such as how many vulnerabilities a package contains that you are importing. And most important, suggesting a fix if known vulnerabilities are found.
If you like the extension, we‚Äôd love it if you could [rate it](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=snyk-security.vscode-vuln-cost&ssr=false#review-details).

üîí Your code and manifest files never leave your machine. Snyk only needs the dependency name and version to test against our constantly updated vulnerability database.

## Detect vulnerabilities in third-party open source packages automatically while you code.


- **Find security vulnerabilities in the npm packages you import:** see the number of known vulnerabilities in your imported npm packages as soon as you require them!


- **See your project vulnerabilities inline, as you code:** see feedback directly in your editor. Vuln Cost displays the number of vulnerabilities your packages add to your project.


- **Find security vulnerabilities in your JavaScript packages from well-known CDNs:** Vuln Cost scans any HTML files in your projects and displays vulnerability information about the JavaScript packages you download from your favorite CDN.


- **See in-depth information about your vulnerabilities:** access relevant resources that will give you deeper information about the vulnerabilities that directly affect your project.
