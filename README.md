## Vulnerability scanning in VS Code

Find security vulnerabilities in open source npm packages while you code.
Receive feedback in-line with your code, such as how many vulnerabilities a package contains that you are importing.

🔒 Your code and manifest files never leave your machine. Snyk only needs the dependency name and version to test against our constantly updated vulnerability database.

## Detect vulnerabilities in third-party open source packages automatically while you code.


- **Find security vulnerabilities in the npm packages you import:** see the number of known vulnerabilities in your imported npm packages as soon as you require them!


- **See your project vulnerabilities inline, as you code:** see feedback directly in your editor. Vuln Cost displays the number of vulnerabilities your packages add to your project.


- **Find security vulnerabilities in your JavaScript packages from well-known CDNs:** Vuln Cost scans any HTML files in your projects and displays vulnerability information about the JavaScript packages you download from your favorite CDN.


- **See in-depth information about your vulnerabilities:** access relevant resources that will give you deeper information about the vulnerabilities that directly affect your project.
