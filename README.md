## Vulnerability scanning in VS Code

Find security vulnerabilities in open source npm packages while you code.
Receive feedback in-line with your code, such as how many vulnerabilities a package contains that you are importing.

ðŸ”’ Your code and manifest files never leave your machine. Snyk only needs the dependency name and version to test against our constantly updated vulnerability database.

## Detect vulnerabilities in third-party open source packages automatically while you code.


- **Find security vulnerabilities in the npm packages you import:** see the number of known vulnerabilities in your imported npm packages as soon as you require them!


- **See your project vulnerabilities inline, as you code:** see feedback directly in your editor. Vuln Cost displays the number of vulnerabilities your packages add to your project.


- **Find security vulnerabilities in your JavaScript packages from well-known CDNs:** Vuln Cost scans any HTML files in your projects and displays vulnerability information about the JavaScript packages you download from your favorite CDN.


- **See in-depth information about your vulnerabilities:** access relevant resources that will give you deeper information about the vulnerabilities that directly affect your project.
